Project Name- "Titanic Survival Prediction"

Overview:
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers onboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of many lives. This project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is available in Titanic-Dataset.csv. It includes the following features:
1) PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
2) Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
3) Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
4) Name: Passenger's name
5) Sex: Passenger's gender
6) Age: Passenger's age
7) SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
8) Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
9) Ticket: Ticket number
10) Fare: Ticket fare
11) Cabin: Cabin number
12) Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on the available features. The project involves the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
Model building: Training various machine learning algorithms and selecting the best-performing model.
Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations: Creating visualizations to explore the data distribution and understand feature importance.

Deployment: Deploying the trained model for real-time predictions.
Technologies Used
